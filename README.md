Lork
====

The text based dungeon crawler for the @bsjtf CTF 2014.

Installation
====
The files in config/lork/ should be located in the webroot's PARENT directory. This is done to prevent spidering. If you want to keep it in the webroot, you will need to remove the "/../" in the require and include lines.
