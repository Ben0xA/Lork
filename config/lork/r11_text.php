	define("ENDOFGAME", "After you press enter you hear screaming over a speaker! 'NOOOOOOOOOOOO! Impossible. How could you have beat this game?' The three walls that weren't shut off by the steel door all fold away and you find yourself in a clear box. The box is in the middle of a room that has monitors, cables, and networking equipment. A man comes out from behind one of the monitors. 'You are a pain! I can't believe you beat me at this game! It was my game! MINE!' The man walks back and forth mumbling to himself. 'I'll just restart the game again. I can do that. YES!' The man runs over to the computer to restart this never ending game.<BR /><BR />Before he has a chance to type a command, a door bursts open and BSJTF agents storm into the room. An agent goes over to a terminal and presses a release button. The steel door opens and the shaft is moved away. The BSJTF leader comes up to you with pride and salutes you. 'Had you not initiated that connection, we might never have found you. Great job agent! We have a lot of work to do before our agency is back up and running. But until that time, you should take a nice vacation. I'm thinking you should take a nice trip to Detroit.'<BR /><BR />You are rushed away to the waiting SUV to take you home. Inside is an envelope with your name on it. You open it and it reads: flag=I_SAVED_AN_ENTIRE_AGENCY_AND_ALL_I_GOT_WAS_A_STUPID_CARD<BR /><BR />The End! Thank you for playing!<BR /><BR />Save your flags for when the framework comes back up.");
